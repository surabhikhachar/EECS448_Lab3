          While many believe that Kansas was going to break their Big 12 streak this year, I however stayed an avid
          fan throughout the year. "KU's worst team" as many so lovingly put it throughout the season was at its worst, ranked
          second in the conference, projected for the 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, and was projected to be one of the highest
          scoring teams during Bill Self's reign. With a starting lineup of Udoka Azubuike, LaGerald Vick, Svi Mykhailiuk, Devonte Graham, and
          Malik Newman, the Kansas basketball team is set for a game of strong offensive play with a lot of depth. And while it may seem like this season
          has not been outstanding purely in terms of rankings, the "live by three, die by three" motto has carried the team quite a bit this year. After
          taking a look back from the first few games of conference play, the team has grown immensely, clinching the first place spot after a
          strong win against West Virginia at home.
